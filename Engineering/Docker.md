Docker is an [[open-source]] platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It uses OS-level [[virtualization]] to package applications and services as lightweight, portable, self-sufficient [[container]]s. Docker [[container]]s leverage the operating system's [[kernel]] to isolate applications and services from each other, making it possible to run multiple [[container]]s on the same machine without conflicts.
