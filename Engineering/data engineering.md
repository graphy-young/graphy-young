Data engineering is the process of designing and managing the infrastructure for collecting, storing, processing, and transmitting data. It plays a crucial role in preparing data for analysis and ensuring its availability to data scientists and analysts. Data engineers perform various tasks, including:

1. Data Collection: Gathering data from diverse sources and transporting it to storage repositories like [[data warehouse]]s or [[data lake]]s.

2. Data Processing: Handling large-scale data, refining it, and transforming it to enhance data quality and align it with business requirements.

3. Data Storage: Designing systems to securely store and manage data, which may involve databases, distributed file systems, or cloud storage solutions.

4. Data Transmission: Moving data to its required destinations and setting up data pipelines for real-time or batch processing.

5. Monitoring and Maintenance: Monitoring data systems, addressing issues, and optimizing performance to ensure data infrastructure reliability.

Data engineering is essential for providing the foundational infrastructure that enables organizations to leverage data for informed decision-making and analytics.
