> Distributed Version Control System

Distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project. keeping a record of each change made to the code base. Git is particularly known for its speed, flexibility, and distributed nature.

## Key feature and concepts

1. **Version Control**: Git keeps track of changes in the source code over time, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed.
2. **Distributed System**: Each developer working on a project has their own local copy of the entire project repository. This enables collaboration without the need for a central server.
3. **Branching**: Developers can create branches to work on specific features or fixes independently. Branches can later be merged to incorporate changes into the main codebase.
4. **Merging and Rebasing**: Git provides tools for combining changes from from different branches. Merging and rebasing are techniques used to integrate changes smoothly.
5. **History Tracking**: Git maintains a complete history of all changes made to the codebase, including who made the changes and when.
6. **Remote Repositories**: Git supports remote repositories, allowing developers to synchronize their local repositories with a central repository or with other developers.
