>Structured Query Language, as known as SEQUEL

A domain-specific language used in programming and managing [[relational database]]s. It is designed for managing and manipulating data held in a [[Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)]] or for stream processing in a [[relational data stream management system (RDSMS)]]. SQL is used for tasks such as querying data, updating data, inserting data, and deleting data in a database. It provides a standardized way to interact with databases, allowing users to define, manipulate, and control data.
